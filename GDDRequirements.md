# GROWING DEGREE DAYS

## Introduction:
This is a project as part of our coursework for the term.

From Wikipedia:

Growing degree days (GDD), also called growing degree units (GDUs), are a heuristic tool in phenology. 
GDD are a measure of heat accumulation used by horticulturists, gardeners, and farmers to predict plant and animal development rates such as the date that a flower will bloom, or a crop will reach maturity.
